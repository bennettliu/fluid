# PIC/FLIP Fluid Simulation


## To Build
Use the standard CMake pipeline:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```
To compile in Release mode (turns on compiler optimizations) use
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```
instead.

Both Bennett and Sindhu have completed the course evaluation.
